# About
This is a project made for fun in early 2024 (although uploaded in mid 2024) intended to help me learn advanced OOP concepts and C++ programming. Tetris is a classic retro game that
almost everybody knows about, and I can say that mimicking is one of the best learning strategies; that's why I decided to make this project out!

## Running the game
